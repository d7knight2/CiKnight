# Server Configuration
# PORT: The port the application will listen on
#       - Local development: Use 3000 (default if not set)
#       - Cloud Run: Automatically set to 8080 by Cloud Run
#       - Docker: Set via -e PORT=<port> when running container

# Webhook Security Configuration
# IP validation is DISABLED in the current implementation
# All incoming webhook requests are accepted regardless of IP address
# The following environment variables are not used but kept for reference:
#
# WEBHOOK_IP_RESTRICTION_ENABLED: (Unused) Enable/disable IP address validation
#   - Previously: Set to 'false', '0', 'no', or 'off' to disable IP restrictions
#   - Previously: Any other value (including undefined) enabled IP restrictions (default: enabled)
#   - Current: IP validation is disabled in code, this variable has no effect
#
# WEBHOOK_IP_FAIL_OPEN: (Unused) Behavior when IP validation fails due to errors
#   - Previously: Set to 'true' to allow requests when validation fails (fail-open mode)
#   - Previously: Set to 'false' to reject requests when validation fails (fail-closed mode)
#   - Current: Not applicable as IP validation is disabled
#
# TRUST_PROXY: Trust proxy headers for IP extraction
#   - Set to 'true' to trust X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers
#   - Set to 'false' (default) to only use socket remote address
#   - ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Set to 'true' when running behind a reverse proxy or load balancer
#     (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS ALB, nginx, Cloudflare) to correctly extract client IPs
#   - When running behind a proxy, the socket IP will be an internal IP (like 169.254.x.x)
#     and the actual client IP will be in the X-Forwarded-For header
#   - Only enable if behind a trusted reverse proxy to prevent header spoofing attacks

# Optional: Specific installation ID if you want to test with a specific installation
# GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID=your_installation_id
